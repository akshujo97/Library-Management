# Library-Management
This is a simple Library Management project built in Python

Welcome to Akshay's Library where you will get all the books you want to read.
* Users will get to choose what they wanna do- Display Library, Add or Remove books, Return any book if lended, Lend a book 
* This has all the features as what an online library should have including if someone lends a book and you input that book it will display the lender's name.
* All the basic functionalities have been added like to remove any book or to add any book etc
* It uses an infinite while loop and we have to press 'n' to get out of that while and it will accept that input only as long as all the books have been returned
* If a book is already in the library and if user is trying to return it then it will prompt to first lend the book<br>
* Maintains a dictionary of the book with the person's name who have lended the book

## Requirements:

* Nothing, just import it in your python IDE and it should run fine

## Hope you enjoy it 
## Peace out
